# OpenUtau-Arpasing-Updates
Updates to OpenUtau's Arpasing Phonemizer 

The only update I have right now is suport for more phonemes. 
That file is arapasing.yaml, in order to install it what you need to do is download it of this github page, go to the folder you have OpenUtau in, find the one called Plugins and drag and drop the file in.

I'm may make more of these updates in the future, I don't realy know.
